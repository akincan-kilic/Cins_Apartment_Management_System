""" TODO
    - Make the GUI more responsive.
    - Maybe add random user images for the client card.
    - Make the chat messages look better. Maybe add a divider between the messages.
    - Or make the timestamps appear bold and the messages appear normal. Or change their color idk.
    - Write a report.
    - If a card with the same ID is trying to register, the server should send a message to the client saying that the ID is already in use.
    - Make all buttons on the ClientGUI purple, and make the send button green.
    - Make all the buttons on the ServerGUI goldenrod.
    - Make all logging module relates stuff in a decorator.
    - Since HOST PORT Textboxes are the exact same on both client and server GUI, put them on the Utility class.
    - Add user input checking to those checkboxes, so host and port can only be numbers etc.
